side, and a back side.[WAIT]
When both sides look the[BREAK]
same, it will be[WAIT]
complete.[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

003-E:The front and back are[BREAK]
perfectly alike![WAIT]
You won't find another[BREAK]

He's an artistic prodigy![CONTINUE]
He can transform anything[BREAK]

people everywhere...[WAIT]
That is the value of[BREAK]
fine art![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

00A-E:Dreams, reality...[BREAK]
Front, back...[CONTINUE]
How can you tell the real[BREAK]
world from a fake one?[WAIT]
This bed knows the[BREAK]
answer to that question...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

00B-E:I wonder what the dream[BREAK]
world version of me is[WAIT]

00C-E:Ah... Hm? How'd I get over[BREAK]

I coulda swore I fell asleep[BREAK]

Man. I bet if I laid in[BREAK]

Has he rolled off to some[BREAK]

Hm? If you want to rest[BREAK]
on the [COLOR_ON]Gummy Sofa[COLOR_OFF], feel[WAIT]

waiting, everyone![WAIT]
With Popoku's feathers in[BREAK]
hand, at last, my latest[WAIT]

[COLOR_ON]The Dream Pillow[COLOR_OFF]![CONTINUE]
They say that if you[BREAK]
sleep with one of my[WAIT]
pillows, you will be[BREAK]
sent to the land of[WAIT]
dreams...[WAIT]
Either way, please take[BREAK]

019-E:Pierro: Ah! It's you![WAIT]
You came at just the[BREAK]
right time![WAIT]
I was just thinking of[BREAK]
making a pillow for you.[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

La[COLOR_ON]tt[COLOR_OFF]al when read[BREAK]

02D-E:[NAME1]: The dream[BREAK]

I wonder if that has[BREAK]
anything to do with what[WAIT]
[COLOR_ON]T[COLOR_OFF]alla[COLOR_ON]t[COLOR_OFF] was saying before.[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

02E-E:Hmm...[WAIT]
It's nearly finished, but...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

02F-E:There's something[BREAK]
missing...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

030-E:Hmmm... I just can't[BREAK]
put my finger on it...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

031-E:W-who are you!?[CONTINUE]
And what is it that you[BREAK]
require of I, the great[WAIT]
[COLOR_ON]Greco[COLOR_OFF] of the Art Kids!?[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

This is my latest[BREAK]

038-E:Greco: Wa-ha-ha![BREAK]
You're a sharp one, kid![WAIT]
Right! I left the[BREAK]
[COLOR_ON]Origin Hand[COLOR_OFF] in my[WAIT]
dungeon![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

039-E:Greco: And how perfect[BREAK]
that you should show up[WAIT]
now![CONTINUE]
Go to the dungeon I[BREAK]
created and retrieve for[WAIT]
me the [COLOR_ON]Origin Hand[COLOR_OFF]![WAIT]
If you bring it to me,[BREAK]
I'll show you a REAL[WAIT]
work of art![WAIT]
You'll need this key to[BREAK]
enter the dungeon![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

03A-E:Greco: The theme[BREAK]
of my dungeon is[WAIT]
[COLOR_ON]austerity[COLOR_OFF] and [COLOR_ON]rusticness[COLOR_OFF]...[WAIT]
The beauty of[BREAK]
imperfection.[WAIT]
Enjoy the patina of my[BREAK]
dungeon to your heart's[WAIT]
content![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

03B-E:Greco: Wa-ha-ha!![BREAK]
Great work! You found[WAIT]
the Origin Hand![CONTINUE]
With this, I can complete[BREAK]

Now, to make good on my[BREAK]

BEHOLD![BREAK]
A true work of art![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

03C-E:[CENTER_H]Attached the Origin Hand![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

inside my clock!?[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

043-E:Pierro: Popoku![BREAK]
Ah, Popoku...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

044-E:Pierro: Where have you[BREAK]
been?[WAIT]
I've been looking all[BREAK]
over for you...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

045-E:But, all is well.[WAIT]
At last, I can make a new[BREAK]
pillow![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

[CENTER_H](Eek!)[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

047-E:Pierro: No! Don't run[BREAK]

048-E:Pierro: I told you[BREAK]
not to run, Popoku.[WAIT]
I won't[SETPAUSE]... let it[BREAK]
happen again [NOTE][SIMPLEWAIT][END]

049-E:Thank you very much, all[BREAK]
of you! Please come by my[WAIT]
atelier! I'll be waiting there[BREAK]
with a present for you![WAIT]
My finest [COLOR_ON]pillow[COLOR_OFF]![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

04A-E:Greco: Hmmm...[BREAK]
That bird just now[WAIT]
was very artistic[BREAK]
indeed...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

04B-E:Greco: I'm going[BREAK]
to use that bird[WAIT]
to make my next[BREAK]
work of art![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

04C-E:[COLOR_ON]Chekkit[COLOR_OFF] is pretty good,[WAIT]
but if you ask me, I'd say[BREAK]
[COLOR_ON]Greco[COLOR_OFF]'s works are better.[WAIT]
I really enjoy his clock[BREAK]
theme.[WAIT]
There's something so[BREAK]
mysterious about it...[CONTINUE]
Don't you think so too?[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

04D-E:Of course, the only REAL[BREAK]
artist around here is[WAIT]
Greco![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

04E-E:There was a weird[BREAK]
bird somewhere in[WAIT]
this room, but...[CONTINUE]
I wonder where it[BREAK]
ran off to?[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

04F-E:That bird belongs to[BREAK]
[COLOR_ON]Pierro[COLOR_OFF] the pillow artist!?[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

050-E:There was a bird with all[BREAK]
its feathers plucked[WAIT]
wandering around here[BREAK]
lost and afraid.[WAIT]
Poor thing... I decided[BREAK]
to take it in and care for[WAIT]
it myself. Now it's as[BREAK]
happy as can be![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

051-E:This is the [COLOR_ON]Austere Room[COLOR_OFF].[CONTINUE]
[COLOR_ON]Greco[COLOR_OFF]'s treasured[BREAK]
artwork is stored in here.[WAIT]
You can't get in unless[BREAK]
you have the [COLOR_ON]Sesame Key[COLOR_OFF].[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

052-E:This is the [COLOR_ON]Rustic Room[COLOR_OFF].[CONTINUE]
Unfortunately, you can't[BREAK]
go in because the door[WAIT]
is, well... rusted shut.[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

053-E:The [COLOR_ON]Austere Room[COLOR_OFF] and[BREAK]
the [COLOR_ON]Rustic Room[COLOR_OFF]...[WAIT]
The names themselves[BREAK]
almost have a bitter[WAIT]
taste...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

054-E:I saw it!!! It was a UFO![BREAK]
No doubt about it!!![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

055-E:Very nice. I too will try[BREAK]
going into the[WAIT]
[COLOR_ON]Austere Room[COLOR_OFF].[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

056-E:[NAME1]: I wonder how[BREAK]
we get this box open...?[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

057-E:That's the [COLOR_ON]Sesame[BREAK]
Key[COLOR_OFF] isn't it.[CONTINUE]
Will you use the[BREAK]
[COLOR_ON]Sesame Key[COLOR_OFF]?[WAIT]
 [MENU1]Use it    [MENU2]Nah[MENU_END][END]

A tomato...[WAIT]
Ugh... This whole art[BREAK]
thing's starting to leave[WAIT]
a bad taste in my mouth.[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

05A-E:[NAME1]: What kind of[BREAK]

to be...?[WAIT]
Hmmm...?[WAIT]
[CENTER_H]''I'm searching for a lost[BREAK]

A shadow to every light.[WAIT]
A back to every front.[WAIT]
Do the same thing twice...[WAIT]
And it will go back to the[BREAK]

That is the shortest path[BREAK]
to the end...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

it for more information![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

204-E:Welcome to [COLOR_ON]Soy TV[COLOR_OFF][BREAK]

20E-E:If you're not here to[BREAK]
play, you must leave![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

20F-E:Late night breaking news![WAIT]
Owing to a complete lack[BREAK]
of funding, Soy TV has[WAIT]
gone BANKRUPT![WAIT]
Even [NAME1]'s stunning[BREAK]
performance was not[WAIT]
televised at all.[WAIT]
Will no wealthy sponsors[BREAK]
come to their aid?[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

hunger... For battle![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

212-E:Big Bertha: Well that's[BREAK]
no good at all, now is it?[WAIT]
I don't particularly[BREAK]
like weak men.[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

213-E:Big Bertha: How very[BREAK]
disappointing.[WAIT]
I will be sharpening my[BREAK]

can rival you![WAIT]
You are the strongest

But, remember this:[WAIT]
Sooner or later, someone[BREAK]

challenge you.[WAIT]
Until then, please[BREAK]
continue marching[WAIT]
ever-onwards on your[BREAK]
adventure.[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

21A-E:Big Bertha: Whew...[CONTINUE]
Lounge around here long[BREAK]
enough, and the lack of[WAIT]
exercise really starts[BREAK]
to pile on in rolls...[WAIT]
I may be in a mood to[BREAK]
work up a bit of a[WAIT]
sweat.[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

21B-E:Perhaps...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

223-E:Rather unfortunate.[BREAK]
Your rank has gone down.[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

body, and now it's time[WAIT]
to sharpen your mind![CONTINUE]
Have you completed the[BREAK]

If you have, you should[BREAK]
try heading over to[WAIT]
NampLagoon.[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

225-E:Hm? You want to play[BREAK]

Heheh, We're both[BREAK]
Droppers, you and me![WAIT]
Kind of depressing,[BREAK]
ain't it...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

28A-E:Grown-ups who were slain[BREAK]
in battles have all become[WAIT]
monsters.[WAIT]
Outside towns and[BREAK]
villages, they're all over[WAIT]
the place![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

28B-E:What's this? Come to see[BREAK]
your girlfriend [COLOR_ON]Pasaran[COLOR_OFF]?[WAIT]
Well, she just stepped[BREAK]

28C-E:There's [COLOR_ON]6[COLOR_OFF] Super Kids in[BREAK]

you can leave The Spillage.[WAIT]
To battle... Or to like[BREAK]

Agh! I don't like EITHER[BREAK]
option![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

290-E:Tomaki: Hi there! How are[BREAK]
you?[WAIT]
Along your journey, be[BREAK]
sure to ask Tomagri for[WAIT]
helpful advice![WAIT]
He's usually dozing off[BREAK]
on top of signs...[WAIT]
But, if you're ever lost,[BREAK]
try reading them![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

291-E:Tomaki: Hi there! How are[BREAK]
you?[WAIT]
There are 2 levels of[BREAK]
[COLOR_ON]AWE![COLOR_OFF] techniques![WAIT]
Build up enough points and[BREAK]
you can use the 1st one...[WAIT]
And fill the bar up[BREAK]
completely to use the 2nd![WAIT]
Setting your gimmicks to[BREAK]
higher difficulty levels[WAIT]
will let you build up[BREAK]
[COLOR_ON]AWE![COLOR_OFF] points faster![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

292-E:Tomaki: Hi there! How are[BREAK]
you?[WAIT]
Gimmicks afflicted with[BREAK]
[COLOR_ON]jank[COLOR_OFF] status have their[WAIT]
difficulty level raised[BREAK]
by 2![WAIT]
There are items that can[BREAK]
fix janky gimmicks,[WAIT]
but still...[WAIT]
Be careful![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

293-E:Tomaki: Hi there! How are[BREAK]
you?[WAIT]
It looks like you've made[BREAK]
some new friends![WAIT]
If you select [COLOR_ON]Friend[COLOR_OFF] in[BREAK]
the menu, you can pick[WAIT]
which friend you bring[BREAK]
with you into battle![WAIT]
Everyone has their own[BREAK]
unique gimmicks, so try[WAIT]
them all out![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

294-E:Tomaki: Hi there! How are[BREAK]
you?[WAIT]
Friends who don't fight[BREAK]
still earn a small amount[WAIT]
of [COLOR_ON]EXP![COLOR_OFF][WAIT]
But, a friend who does[BREAK]
fight will level up a lot[WAIT]
faster![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

295-E:Tomaki: Hi there! How are[BREAK]
you?[WAIT]
You've all become a lot[BREAK]
stronger, haven't you?[WAIT]
It's a good idea to make[BREAK]
sure all your friends[WAIT]
are just as strong by[BREAK]
swapping them all into[WAIT]
battle from time to time![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

296-E:Tomaki: Hi there! How are[BREAK]
you?[WAIT]
You've made it to[BREAK]
Gimmick Palace at last![WAIT]
Are you all stocked up[BREAK]
on items?[WAIT]
Are your friends in good[BREAK]
shape?[WAIT]
It sure looks like a big,[BREAK]
big place inside, so[WAIT]
you'd better be prepared![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

The Bananaconda comes[BREAK]

You may use the yellow[BREAK]

2C2-E:Playing with fire is[BREAK]

The entire place is made[BREAK]

for them![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

2C6-E:You can reach the[BREAK]
Lardosseum if you take[WAIT]
this blue bananaconda.[WAIT]
But, if you don't have a[BREAK]
blunana, you'll have to[WAIT]
take the long way through[BREAK]
the [COLOR_ON]sewers[COLOR_OFF].[CONTINUE]
Careful not to get swept[BREAK]
away while you swim[WAIT]
through there![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

2C7-E:Even though I'm wearing a[BREAK]
full suit, I've never[WAIT]
gotten stuck inside a[BREAK]
bananaconda before.[WAIT]
Pretty lucky, dont'cha[BREAK]

2CF-E:Denied. I will first need[BREAK]
to evaluate your[WAIT]
earthshakingness![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

2D0-E:My apologies, but you'll[BREAK]
have to step aside.[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

2D1-E:Wo-ho-ho-ho...[WAIT]
Do you really think it's[BREAK]
appropriate to ask a lady[WAIT]
such as myself to jiggle[BREAK]
her body like that?[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

2D2-E:Wha-...[WAIT]
What was that?![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

2D3-E:WHOA!!![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

You're not hurt, are you?[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

2EA-E:[NAME2]: Seems fine...[CONTINUE]

2EC-E:[NAME1]: What the...?[BREAK]

It looks like I blew it![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

2F2-E:[NAME1]: ...what a pain.[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

2F3-E:Anyways, in order to[BREAK]
enter the Lardosseum,[WAIT]
you will need some full[BREAK]
suits of your own. But...[CONTINUE]
Do you want to know[BREAK]
where you can find them?[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

2F4-E:You're going to need to[BREAK]
pay a visit to the[WAIT]
[COLOR_ON]suit designer[COLOR_OFF] in town.[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

2F5-E:You can get to the[BREAK]
[COLOR_ON]full suit shop[COLOR_OFF] by passing[WAIT]

If you have a blunana to[BREAK]

30B-E:It's a bit embarrassing,[BREAK]

31C-E:[NAME3]: Ah, so about[BREAK]

It's best to get this[BREAK]
done in one try.[WAIT]
That's the safest way,[BREAK]
anyway.[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

this thing is safe?[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

31E-E:[NAME3]: Don't worry[BREAK]
about it! Thank[WAIT]

31F-E:[NAME3]: Lately I've been[BREAK]

stuck in a Bananaconda...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

320-E:[NAME3]: I want to repay[BREAK]

some full suits then, no?[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

323-E:[NAME1]: That's right...[BREAK]
And like, ASAP.[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

324-E:[NAME3]: In that case,[BREAK]

you're after![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

325-E:[NAME1]: ...Hm?[BREAK]
Really now?[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

make some for you free[BREAK]
of charge![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

327-E:[NAME1]: Really?[BREAK]
That's great!!![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

328-E:[NAME3]: Let's head over[BREAK]

Bananaconda again, let's[WAIT]

32B-E:[NAME3]... is the name.[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

32C-E:[NAME1]: Speaking of[BREAK]
which...[WAIT]
It feels like I'm[BREAK]
forgetting something...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

32D-E:[NAME1]: This was next[BREAK]

A letter? I wonder who[WAIT]
it's from.[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

It's nothing.[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

333-E:I'm sorry you have to see[BREAK]

334-E:[CENTER_H]For now, [COLOR_ON][NAME3][COLOR_OFF][BREAK]

335-E:[NAME3]: Um, so I don't[BREAK]
get stuck again, let's take[WAIT]
the sewers to get there.[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

336-E:[NAME3]: I think I've[BREAK]
gotten a little bit slimmer![WAIT]
[CENTER_HV]Look![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

337-E:[NAME3]: Here![CONTINUE]
I'll have your suits[BREAK]
prepared in a jiffy![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

338-E:[NAME2]: This is gonna be[BREAK]
so much fun![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

339-E:[NAME2]: I've never worn[BREAK]
designer clothes straight[WAIT]
from the maker![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

33A-E:[NAME1]: Are you really[BREAK]
happy that your first[WAIT]
designer clothes[BREAK]
experience is gonna be[WAIT]
a full suit though?[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

33B-E:[NAME2]: Oh yeah, about[BREAK]
that...[WAIT]
There's something I've[BREAK]
been meaning to ask...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

33C-E:[CENTER_HV]What DO they mean by...[WAIT]
[CENTER_HV][SIZE_BIG]full[SIZE_NORMAL][WAIT]
[CENTER_HV]anyway?[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

Now, if you would, please[BREAK]

wonderful, long-lasting,[BREAK]
[NAME3]-brand...[CONTINUE]
Special full suits![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

33F-E:[CENTER_HV]...hmmm...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

341-E:[NAME2]: Ah! [NAME1]![BREAK]
That one's MINE![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

342-E:[NAME1]: Oh, really?[WAIT]
But this thing fits me[BREAK]
perfectly.[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

343-E:[NAME1]: ...or maybe,[BREAK]
[NAME2]...[WAIT]
Did you lie about[BREAK]
your size?[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

344-E:[NAME2]: N-...[WAIT]
[CENTER_HV][SIZE_BIG]NANI?![SIZE_NORMAL][WAIT]

347-E:[NAME2]: ...I... [SIMPLEWAIT][END]

348-E:[CENTER_HV][SIZE_BIG]HATE IT![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

349-E:[NAME1]: But, if you[BREAK]
don't wear it...[CONTINUE]
There's no way we can[BREAK]
get into the Lardosseum[WAIT]
and take down What.[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

34A-E:[NAME1]: And if we don't[BREAK]
do that, meeting with[WAIT]
[COLOR_ON]Abira[COLOR_OFF] is out of the[BREAK]
question.[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

34B-E:[NAME2]: F-...fine.[CONTINUE]
If it's for my beloved[BREAK]

the articles they run[BREAK]
about the secrets of the[WAIT]
kingdom![CONTINUE]
That's why they operate[BREAK]
out of a secret office, the[WAIT]
whereabouts of which[BREAK]
nobody knows![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

419-E:Whether you take the[BREAK]
highway or the subway,[WAIT]

445-E:Mackby: Truly a shame,[BREAK]
but this is your last stop.[WAIT]
You have outlived your[BREAK]

time for you to disappear.[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

446-E:[NAME1]: You...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

447-E:[CENTER_HV][SIZE_BIG]COWARD!!![SIZE_NORMAL][WAIT]

test go?[WAIT]
Sure looks like everything[BREAK]
went OK.[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

44D-E:Mackby: Well then...[WAIT]
Your first assignment,[BREAK]
should you choose to[WAIT]
accept it...[WAIT]
Is to get the inside scoop[BREAK]
on what is held within the[WAIT]

There are wonderful[BREAK]

can handle them all[WAIT]
perfectly is a Speed[BREAK]
Master.[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

4D7-E:One who can rein in the[BREAK]
unwieldy [COLOR_ON]Excite[COLOR_OFF] gimmicks[WAIT]
becomes an Excite Master.[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

4D8-E:Master each and every[BREAK]
one, and then, you're a...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

However, you can only[BREAK]
get 1 card from them...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

503-E:...Well, it looks like[BREAK]
I still have some.[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

504-E:...Hmm. You're stronger[BREAK]

Or you can engage in a[BREAK]

...Want to hear more?[BREAK]
 [MENU1]Yes!  [MENU2]Nah.[MENU_END][END]

511-E:[COLOR_ON]Gimick Card Battle[COLOR_OFF],[BREAK]

Raise your rank, and you[BREAK]
can challenge the next[WAIT]
Gimica player...[WAIT]
I have no interest in[BREAK]
players weaker than I...[WAIT]
Yet, I am the lowest[BREAK]
ranking Gimica player...[WAIT]
*sniffle*[WAIT]
You will earn 1 [STAR] for[BREAK]
every 3 link duels you[WAIT]
win...[WAIT]
[CENTER_HV]...But,[WAIT]
you will never earn [COLOR_ON][STAR][COLOR_OFF]s[WAIT]
by defeating players of[BREAK]
lower rank...[WAIT]
...You can still lose[BREAK]
[STAR]s if they defeat[WAIT]
you, so watch out...[WAIT]

7F4-E:Bess: You have been a[BREAK]

I am still inexperienced[BREAK]

7F7-E:Welcome to [COLOR_ON]Tartar Valley[COLOR_OFF],[BREAK]
where the night never[WAIT]
ends.[WAIT]
By order of Lilby, we[BREAK]
have all become[WAIT]
invisible... And now,[BREAK]
nobody can tell anyone[WAIT]
apart from one another.[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

7F8-E:Have you been to the[BREAK]
house of the shadow[WAIT]
pumpkin?[CONTINUE]
There, you can learn[BREAK]

Super Kid [COLOR_ON]Lilby[COLOR_OFF]'s[BREAK]
specialty is a sort of...[CONTINUE]
peek-a-boo magic.[WAIT]
And thanks to it, we are[BREAK]
all [COLOR_ON]invisible![COLOR_OFF][SIMPLEWAIT][END]

7FA-E:Hit anything with a lick[BREAK]
of magic paint, and it'll[WAIT]
turn invisible![WAIT]
However, it washes right[BREAK]
off with water! If it[WAIT]
rains, watch out![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

7FB-E:Everyone calls the huge[BREAK]
tree in town the [COLOR_ON]magical[WAIT]
tree[COLOR_OFF].[WAIT]
It's connected to Lilby's[BREAK]
[COLOR_ON]magical living room[COLOR_OFF].[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

7FC-E:The [COLOR_ON]Shrieking Sisters[COLOR_OFF][BREAK]
Beth, Bess, and Bena live[WAIT]

Rumor has it that it[BREAK]

7FD-E:The [COLOR_ON]Shrieking Sisters[COLOR_OFF][BREAK]
live in the [COLOR_ON]Moon Chapel[COLOR_OFF][WAIT]
atop Mt. S'creme.[WAIT]
They say that the moon[BREAK]
visible above the chapel[WAIT]
is actually a [COLOR_ON]blimp[COLOR_OFF]![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

7FE-E:Do you know about[BREAK]
the [COLOR_ON]CatBat Kid[COLOR_OFF]?[CONTINUE]
 [MENU1]Yup   [MENU2]Nope[MENU_END][END]

7FF-E:The CatBat Kid is a[BREAK]
die-hard fan of Super Kid[WAIT]
Lilby.[CONTINUE]
For her, he'd even slit[BREAK]
his own mama's throat...[WAIT]
Scary stuff...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

800-E:Careful not to let him[BREAK]
steal your valuables![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

801-E:Thanks to the rain I'm[BREAK]

Ahh, it's much better[BREAK]
like this.[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

802-E:Ah... I can be seen...[WAIT]
Now I won't be able to[BREAK]
pull any more pranks...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

803-E:The Rainthooven at the[BREAK]
Moon Chapel has washed[WAIT]
away all this town's[BREAK]
anger and unpleasantness[WAIT]
with its blessed[BREAK]
precipitation...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

804-E:The roots of the magical[BREAK]
tree run through the[WAIT]
earth in this town like[BREAK]
a big web.[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

805-E:Stay in this town too[BREAK]
long, and your spirit'll[WAIT]
get sucked right out![WAIT]
Do you believe it?[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

806-E:Did you see it? At the toy[BREAK]
cemetery right before you[WAIT]
enter town?[WAIT]
...The ghost of some kid...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

807-E:The rain made the roots[BREAK]
of the magical tree move.[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

808-E:3 moving roots remain...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

809-E:2 moving roots remain...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

80A-E:1 moving root remains...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

80B-E:[NOTE]Raise the roots of the[BREAK]
tree good and well [NOTE][WAIT]
[NOTE]And into the living room[BREAK]
they'll reach and swell [NOTE][SIMPLEWAIT][END]

80C-E:The magical tree's roots[BREAK]
have all been tamed.[WAIT]
Have you tried stopping[BREAK]
by the tree itself?[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

80D-E:If I can become invisible[BREAK]
again, I'll be sure to[WAIT]
play my heart out...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

80E-E:Nobody believes it, but...[WAIT]
The magical tree has[BREAK]
died.[WAIT]
The sounds of the roots[BREAK]
wiggling in the ground[WAIT]
can no longer be heard...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

80F-E:[CENTER_HV]Rain! Rain![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

810-E:Ahh! The magic paint[BREAK]

815-E:[NAME1]: C'MON![WAIT]
Unhand that toy part!![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

816-E:Ge-he-he... No way, pal.[WAIT]
The toy part belongs to[BREAK]

If you want it so bad,[WAIT]
just you try and catch[BREAK]
me![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

817-E:Ge-he-he...[BREAK]
Can't get me in here![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

818-E:[NAME1]: Son of a mama...![BREAK]
We can't give up here![WAIT]
There's got to be some[BREAK]
way to get inside that[WAIT]
tree![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

819-E:[NAME2]: Hey! Why not try[BREAK]
jumping into the valley?[CONTINUE]
If you can ride the wind[BREAK]
and become a star, then[WAIT]
you'll have no trouble[BREAK]
getting the tree to open[WAIT]
up![WAIT]
C'mon! Let's go![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

81A-E:[NAME1]: No way![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

81B-E:[NAME1]: ...For now, let's[BREAK]
head back into town.[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

81C-E:With this rain, the roots[BREAK]
of the magical tree have[WAIT]
started to move![WAIT]
They're going all over[BREAK]
the place, so check[WAIT]
everywhere in town![WAIT]
But, be careful! Don't[BREAK]
get too close or they[WAIT]
might attack![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

81D-E:Gi-gi-gi-gi...[BREAK]

Kid, you are reborn![WAIT]
Incidentally, I have[BREAK]
managed to lure in these[WAIT]

way to fight than the[BREAK]
first time around![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

82D-E:Lilby: Hm mmmm... Who is[BREAK]
that over there?[WAIT]
Such a familiar, yet[BREAK]
revolting voice...[WAIT]
Ahh... I see now.[BREAK]
It is you...[WAIT]
You've come here for my[BREAK]
kiss, haven't you...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

82E-E:Lilby: Ah... It feels like[BREAK]

If you want to meet[BREAK]

Though it's empty, should[BREAK]

Your Gimmick's attack[BREAK]

A79-E:Welcome to Mayonen Land,[BREAK]
where being pretty is[WAIT]
practically our national[BREAK]
sport![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

A7A-E:Super Kid [COLOR_ON]Oops[COLOR_OFF] is totally[BREAK]
obsessed with being[WAIT]
squeaky-clean and[BREAK]
beautiful all the time.[WAIT]
She's literally always[BREAK]
bathing.[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

A7D-E:That Oops gal was real[BREAK]

Things are much better[BREAK]

A7E-E:[COLOR_ON]Oops[COLOR_OFF] has been really[BREAK]

grow something called a[WAIT]
belmush, whatever that is.[WAIT]
I think they're all just[BREAK]

Stop on in and try on[BREAK]
some new threads![WAIT]
Keep going left and you'll[BREAK]
end up at the famous[WAIT]

promote beautiful skin...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

A82-E:The weather's so nice[BREAK]

A84-E:It is said that anyone[BREAK]
who eats a belmush will[WAIT]
become beautiful from the[BREAK]

A85-E:Am I pretty?[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

A86-E:Professor Enokin is hard[BREAK]
at work researching the[WAIT]
[COLOR_ON]Belmush[COLOR_OFF] Mushroom...[WAIT]
If you eat one, your skin[BREAK]
will become incredibly[WAIT]
supple![WAIT]
...or so they say.[WAIT]
I wonder if the rumors[BREAK]
are true?[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

A87-E:My skin is sooooo smooth[BREAK]
thanks to the Belmush![WAIT]
Care to give it a quick[BREAK]
touch?[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

A88-E:This is the [COLOR_ON]Mushroom[BREAK]

all sorts of mysterious[BREAK]
mushrooms are studied.[WAIT]
If you want to speak with[BREAK]
[COLOR_ON]Prof. Enokin[COLOR_OFF], he's in the[WAIT]
next room conducting[BREAK]
research.[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

A89-E:Prof. Enokin finally[BREAK]
managed to grow a big[WAIT]

A8A-E:Enokin: Hmmmm...[SETPAUSE][BREAK]
What a bother...[WAIT]
The [COLOR_ON]belmush[COLOR_OFF] won't grow[BREAK]
unless I give it some[WAIT]
[COLOR_ON]special sauce.[COLOR_OFF][SIMPLEWAIT][END]

A8B-E:[NAME1]: Special sauce?[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

A8C-E:Enokin: [COLOR_ON]Mayo Hot Springs[BREAK]
water[COLOR_OFF], to be precise.[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

A8D-E:But, since the hot spring[BREAK]
has dried up, there's not[WAIT]
a chance I'll be able to[BREAK]
make this mushroom[WAIT]
grow...[CONTINUE]
If only there was some[BREAK]
way to get some of that[WAIT]
water...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

A8E-E:Enokin: In order to make[BREAK]
the [COLOR_ON]belmush[COLOR_OFF] grow, I need[WAIT]
some [COLOR_ON]mayo water[COLOR_OFF]...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

A8F-E:Welcome to the famous[BREAK]

you, but due to a[WAIT]
complete water outage, it[BREAK]
is currently closed.[WAIT]
It seems that the mayo[BREAK]

The mayo hole is just[BREAK]

A90-E:How would you like to get[BREAK]
your very own Mayo Hot[WAIT]

A91-E:Ah... but... since the[BREAK]

Why have a pot[BREAK]

A92-E:If you don't get one now,[BREAK]

A93-E:Pothead: Hey! This is a[BREAK]

A98-E:Oh no no no no... I can't[BREAK]
let any guests into the[WAIT]

The water was just[BREAK]

Some weird [COLOR_ON]robot[COLOR_OFF] is[BREAK]
hogging all the water[WAIT]

And, the cave is teeming[BREAK]
with frogs...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

A99-E:[NAME1]: But... I want[BREAK]

A9A-E:Well, deal with the robot[BREAK]
then.[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

A9B-E:What's that? Some[BREAK]
weirdo's blocking the[WAIT]
entrance to the cavern?[WAIT]
Maybe you should try[BREAK]
listening reeeeeeeeeeal[WAIT]
carefully to what he has[BREAK]
to say![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

A9C-E:The water's back! That[BREAK]
means I can start[WAIT]
dealing pots again![WAIT]
Well? Gonna go take a dip[BREAK]

your hot pot?[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

A9D-E:Alright! We're back in[BREAK]

completely red...[WAIT]
That's the sort of thing[BREAK]
Abira ought to like...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

AA8-E:[NAME1]: Hm... [SETPAUSE]to tell the[BREAK]

with him myself.[CONTINUE]
And, I've been told if I[BREAK]
can defeat all 6 of the[WAIT]
Super Kids, I might just[BREAK]
get my chance...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

AA9-E:No way! Really?[BREAK]
Well then, count me in too![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

Stand back![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

AB5-E:[NAME2]: ...Hm? That's[BREAK]

AB7-E:[NAME1]: Look...[CONTINUE]

That's just the way these[BREAK]
