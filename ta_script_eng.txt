He's an artistic prodigy![CONTINUE]
Chekkit can transform[BREAK]

That is the value of[BREAK]
fine art![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

00A-E:Dreams, reality...[BREAK]
Front, back...[CONTINUE]
How can you tell the real[BREAK]
world from a fake one?[WAIT]
This bed here knows the[BREAK]
answer to that question...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

the dream world is like...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

00C-E:Ah... Hm?[BREAK]

00E-E:Just how does that guy[BREAK]

Has he rolled off to some[BREAK]
random place again?[WAIT]
Hm? If you want to rest[BREAK]
on the [COLOR_ON]Gummy Sofa[COLOR_OFF], feel[CONTINUE]

With Popoku's feathers in[BREAK]

[COLOR_ON]The Dream Pillow[COLOR_OFF]![WAIT]
They say that if you[BREAK]

the land of dreams...[WAIT]
Either way, please take it![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

019-E:Pierro: Ah! It's you![WAIT]
You came at just the[BREAK]
right time![WAIT]
I was just thinking of[BREAK]
making a pillow for you.[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

A path will open up for[BREAK]

anything to do with what[CONTINUE]
[COLOR_ON]T[COLOR_OFF]alla[COLOR_ON]t[COLOR_OFF] was saying before.[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

02E-E:Hmm...[WAIT]
It's nearly finished, but...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

02F-E:There's something[BREAK]
missing...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

030-E:Hmmm... I just can't put[BREAK]
my finger on it...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

031-E:W-who are you!?[WAIT]
And what is it that you[BREAK]

doesn't have any hands!![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

038-E:Greco: Wa-ha-ha![BREAK]
You're a sharp one, kid![WAIT]
Right! I left the [COLOR_ON]Origin[BREAK]
Hand[COLOR_OFF] in my dungeon![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

039-E:Greco: And how perfect[BREAK]
for you to show up now![WAIT]
Head to the dungeon I[BREAK]
created and retrieve for[CONTINUE]

If you bring it to me...[BREAK]
Then I'll show you a REAL[CONTINUE]
work of art![WAIT]
You'll need this key to[BREAK]
enter the dungeon![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

03A-E:Greco: The theme I used[BREAK]
for my dungeon is...[CONTINUE]
[COLOR_ON]austerity[COLOR_OFF] and [COLOR_ON]rusticness[COLOR_OFF]...[WAIT]
The very beauty of...[BREAK]
imperfection.[WAIT]
Enjoy the patina of my[BREAK]
dungeon to your heart's[CONTINUE]

03B-E:Greco: Wa-ha-ha!![BREAK]

At last, I can make a new[BREAK]

047-E:Pierro: No![BREAK]
Don't run away...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

Please come by my atelier![BREAK]
I'll be waiting there with a[CONTINUE]

My finest [COLOR_ON]pillow[COLOR_OFF]![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

04A-E:Greco: Hmmm...[BREAK]
That bird just now was[CONTINUE]
very artistic indeed...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

04B-E:Greco: I'm going to use[BREAK]
that bird to make my[CONTINUE]
next work of art![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

04C-E:[COLOR_ON]Chekkit[COLOR_OFF] is pretty good,[BREAK]
but if you ask me, I'd say[CONTINUE]
[COLOR_ON]Greco[COLOR_OFF]'s works are better.[WAIT]
I really enjoy his clock[BREAK]
theme.[WAIT]
There's something so[BREAK]
mysterious about it...[CONTINUE]
Don't you think so too?[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

04D-E:Naturally, the only REAL[BREAK]
artist around here is the[CONTINUE]
great Greco![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

04E-E:There was a weird bird[BREAK]
somewhere in this room,[CONTINUE]
but... I wonder where it[BREAK]
ran off to?[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

04F-E:That bird belongs to[BREAK]
[COLOR_ON]Pierro[COLOR_OFF] the pillow artist!?[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

050-E:There was a bird with all[BREAK]
its feathers plucked[CONTINUE]
wandering around here[BREAK]
lost and afraid.[WAIT]
Poor thing... I decided[BREAK]
to take it in and care for[CONTINUE]
it myself. Now it's as[BREAK]
happy as can be![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

051-E:This is the [COLOR_ON]Austere Room[COLOR_OFF].[CONTINUE]
[COLOR_ON]Greco[COLOR_OFF]'s most treasured[BREAK]
artwork is stored in here.[WAIT]
You can't get in unless[BREAK]
you have the [COLOR_ON]Sesame Key[COLOR_OFF].[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

052-E:This is the [COLOR_ON]Rustic Room[COLOR_OFF].[CONTINUE]
Unfortunately, you can't[BREAK]
go in because the door[CONTINUE]
is, well... rusted shut.[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

053-E:The [COLOR_ON]Austere Room[COLOR_OFF] and[BREAK]
the [COLOR_ON]Rustic Room[COLOR_OFF]...[WAIT]
It's like the very names[BREAK]
themselves have an almost[CONTINUE]
bitter taste...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

054-E:I saw it!!! It was a UFO![BREAK]
No doubt about it!!![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

055-E:Very nice.[BREAK]
I too will try going into[CONTINUE]
the [COLOR_ON]Austere Room[COLOR_OFF].[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

A tomato...[WAIT]
Ugh... This whole art thing[BREAK]
is starting to leave a bad[CONTINUE]

05A-E:[NAME1]: What kind of[BREAK]
animal is THIS supposed[CONTINUE]
to be...?[WAIT]
Hmmm...?[WAIT]
[CENTER_H]''I'm searching for a lost[BREAK]

A shadow to every light.[WAIT]
A back to every front.[WAIT]
Do the same thing twice...[WAIT]
And it will go back to the[BREAK]

That is the shortest path[BREAK]

295-E:Tomaki: Hi there![BREAK]
How are you?[WAIT]
You've all become a lot[BREAK]
stronger, haven't you?[WAIT]
It's a good idea to make[BREAK]

other by swapping them[CONTINUE]
all into battle from time[BREAK]

go the long way through[BREAK]

That one's MINE![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

342-E:[NAME1]: Oh, really?[WAIT]
But this thing fits me[BREAK]

349-E:[NAME1]: But, if you[BREAK]
don't wear it...[WAIT]
There's no way we can[BREAK]
get into the Lardosseum[CONTINUE]
and take down What.[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

34A-E:[NAME1]: And if we don't[BREAK]
do that, meeting with[CONTINUE]
[COLOR_ON]Abira[COLOR_OFF] is out of the[BREAK]
question.[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

34B-E:[NAME2]: F-...fine.[WAIT]
If it's for my beloved[BREAK]

Scary stuff...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

Do you believe it?[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

806-E:Did you see it?[CONTINUE]
At the toy cemetery right[BREAK]
before you enter town?[WAIT]

have all been tamed.[WAIT]
Have you tried stopping[BREAK]
by the tree itself?[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

80D-E:If I can become invisible[BREAK]
again, I'll be sure to play[CONTINUE]
my heart out...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

80E-E:Nobody believes it, but...[WAIT]
The magical tree has died.[WAIT]
The sounds of the roots[BREAK]
wiggling in the ground[CONTINUE]
can no longer be heard...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

818-E:[NAME1]: Blast it...![BREAK]
We can't give up here![WAIT]
There's gotta be some[BREAK]
way to get into that tree![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

819-E:[NAME2]: Hey! How about[BREAK]

If you can ride the wind 'n[BREAK]

Check everywhere in town![BREAK]
But, be careful![CONTINUE]

Whatever that is.[WAIT]
I think they're all just[BREAK]

A84-E:It is said that anyone[BREAK]
who eats a belmush will[WAIT]

A85-E:Am I pretty?[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

A86-E:Professor Enokin is hard[BREAK]
at work researching the[CONTINUE]
[COLOR_ON]Belmush[COLOR_OFF] Mushroom...[WAIT]
If you eat one, your skin[BREAK]
becomes incredibly supple![WAIT]
...or so they say.[WAIT]

are true?[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

A87-E:My skin is sooooo smooth[BREAK]

If you want to speak with[BREAK]
[COLOR_ON]Prof. Enokin[COLOR_OFF], he's in the[WAIT]

A89-E:Prof. Enokin managed to[BREAK]

A8A-E:Enokin: Hmmmm...[SETPAUSE][BREAK]
What a bother...[WAIT]
The [COLOR_ON]belmush[COLOR_OFF] won't grow[BREAK]

A8D-E:But, since the hot spring[BREAK]

a chance I'll be able to[BREAK]
make this belmush grow...[WAIT]
If only there was some[BREAK]
way to get more of that[CONTINUE]

A8E-E:Enokin: In order to make[BREAK]
the [COLOR_ON]belmush[COLOR_OFF] grow, I need[WAIT]

A8F-E:Welcome to the famous[BREAK]

And, the cave is teeming[BREAK]

A9B-E:What's that? Some[BREAK]

Maybe you should try[BREAK]
